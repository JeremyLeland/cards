Taking a break from the roads and intersections madness, want to play with some cards
  - I haven't made a card game before
  - Could try solitaire, or even something simple like Go Fish
  - I feel like the rabbit hole here will probably be the cards themselves
  - Feels like something I could generate
    - Text and emoticons?
  - Could also try finding existing SVG and use those
    - I just like the idea of vector, don't really want to do raster images
      - Although I'm sure there are tons
    - Would it make sense to create my own SVG programatically and draw that?
      - As opposed to just functions to draw?
      - If I have an SVG, is it easier to do transforms with drawImage?
        - Fake 3D rotation by scaling along the Y axis?

Also want to use this opportunity to practice more intentional experimenting with branches
  - Branch for drawing sub images from large SVGs
    - Might screw this file up, guess we'll see

Easy to find SVGs with entire deck of cards in one image
  - Sub-draw SVGs?
    - Does this make sense?
