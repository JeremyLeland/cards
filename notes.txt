Taking a break from the roads and intersections madness, want to play with some cards
  - I haven't made a card game before
  - Could try solitaire, or even something simple like Go Fish
  - I feel like the rabbit hole here will probably be the cards themselves
  - Feels like something I could generate
    - Text and emoticons?
  - Could also try finding existing SVG and use those
    - I just like the idea of vector, don't really want to do raster images
      - Although I'm sure there are tons
    - Would it make sense to create my own SVG programatically and draw that?
      - As opposed to just functions to draw?
      - If I have an SVG, is it easier to do transforms with drawImage?
        - Fake 3D rotation by scaling along the Y axis?

Also want to use this opportunity to practice more intentional experimenting with branches
  - Branch for drawing sub images from large SVGs
    - Might screw this file up, guess we'll see

Easy to find SVGs with entire deck of cards in one image
  - Sub-draw SVGs?
    - Does this make sense?

SVG drawing was kind of blurry. Dealing with HiDPI adds more headaches.
  - Got something that worked, but I feel like it's blurry
  - My custom canvas was causing problems. 
    - Not sure where, but might be good practice to make a simpler one
    - Generate a matrix for bounds, apply this matrix to mouse coords?
      - Is this any easier than what I'm currently doing saving transform and scale separately?

Made another branch to experiment with text and emojis
  - The numbered cards work nicely
  - The face cards will probably look weird, but I can generate a few just to finish this off
  - The text can be stretched with scaling, so I can do my fake 3D turns

WebGL with rasterized SVG as texture?
  - Wondering how this would look compared to canvas drawing
  - Would make effects like flipping the cards more straightforward (and probably look better)
  - Good practice, if nothing else
