Taking a break from the roads and intersections madness, want to play with some cards
  - I haven't made a card game before
  - Could try solitaire, or even something simple like Go Fish
  - I feel like the rabbit hole here will probably be the cards themselves
  - Feels like something I could generate
    - Text and emoticons?
  - Could also try finding existing SVG and use those
    - I just like the idea of vector, don't really want to do raster images
      - Although I'm sure there are tons
    - Would it make sense to create my own SVG programatically and draw that?
      - As opposed to just functions to draw?
      - If I have an SVG, is it easier to do transforms with drawImage?
        - Fake 3D rotation by scaling along the Y axis?

Also want to use this opportunity to practice more intentional experimenting with branches
  - Branch for drawing sub images from large SVGs
    - Might screw this file up, guess we'll see

Easy to find SVGs with entire deck of cards in one image
  - Sub-draw SVGs?
    - Does this make sense?

The Gnome Aisleriot SVG is nicely organized, at least.
  - Wonder if I could split this up programatically into SVG images, then draw those?
  - How does this compare to drawing a subimage?
    - Seems like it potentially has to render everything
      - since it doesn't know what's within sub image region
  - Seems like there's going to be lots of issues with rasterizing if I try to do this way
    - Really, I only care about rasterizing when window is resized
      - Maybe just force that once, then draw rasterized subimages?
        - Not anticipating any other zooming
  - Could also do this rasterize once for every frame for now
    - It's what would be happening anyway at some point
    - Just force it to happen at desired scale at beginning
      - Then we don't need to keep track of when zoom or screen size changes
        - If it's colloassally slow, then revist above
      - Pathalogical case, every card is visible exactly once
        - We're just segmenting it
        - So either it can do this in a frame or it can't
